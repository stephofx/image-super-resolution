# Image Super-Resolution via Machine Learning
CIS 520 - Machine Learning Final Project
Stephan Xie, Haotong Tian
## Abstract
Image Super-Resolution (ISR) is a technique that reconstructs high-resolution images from low-resolution images. Traditionally, super-resolution has been implemented by custom models or kernel-based methods that modify pixels directly to increase the detail of the image. In recent years, however, a new line of research has focused on using semi-supervised machine learning models (for example Convolutional Neural Networks) to perform this task.
In this project, we implemented several machine learning methods to test their feasibility and accuracy in the domain of ISR. We use uniform metrics to evaluate the performance, and come up with conclusions regarding the differences and similarities among the methods.

4 methods were used:
- Convolutional Autoencoder
- Residual Networks (U-Net)
- Recursive Residual Networks (DRRN)
- GANs
